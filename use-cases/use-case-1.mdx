# Building a To-Do List App

Building a to-do list app is a great way to get started with Vibecode. It's simple enough to build quickly, but powerful enough to learn the core features of app building.

## Getting Started

When you create a new project in Vibecode, you'll be prompted to enter your app idea. Here's a simple prompt you can use:

```
Create a to-do list app where users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks.
Include a simple, clean interface with a text input at the bottom to add new tasks.
```

## Steps to Build

1. Open Vibecode and click "New Project"
2. Enter the prompt above (or customize it to your liking)
3. Click "Generate" and wait for Claude Code to build your app
4. Once generated, test the app on your phone by scanning the QR code
5. Use the pinch-to-build menu to customize colors, add haptics, or tweak the design
6. Test and iterate until you're happy with the result

## What's Next

Once you've built your to-do list app, try adding more features like sorting, categories, or reminders using the pinch-to-build menu!
