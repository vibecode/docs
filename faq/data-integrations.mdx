## Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?

This is a feature that is coming very soon.

## Can I add login to my app?

We currently do not support Auth/DB, so we do not recommend adding this feature even though it is possible. If it is added, there is a chance you could lock yourself out of your own app without being able to recover it since there is no database functionality (yet).

## Can I add third-party APIs to my project?

Yes, you can add authentication by integrating with Vibecode Cloud (currently in beta). Simply prompt the AI to add it and follow the instructions.

## Can I store sensitive API keys in Vibecode?

If you're integrating with an API, we recommend you use Vibecode app ENV tab to store your API keys. However, remember if your keys are prefixed with "EXPO_PUBLIC_", they are public.
