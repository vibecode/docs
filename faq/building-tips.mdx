## How do I build efficiently with Vibecode?

We recommend starting by simplifying your idea into the essential features, then build from there. It also helps to have an initial prompt that details the expected outcome in terms of the look, feel, etc. of your app idea.

## How should I structure my prompts for the best results?

Our AI Agent is pretty good at coming up with what is needed for building your app regardless of the prompt, but for specific features it is best to be as specific as possible. You can even suggest examples (e.g., "An app that is designed like Duolingo" or "make the app have the Google color scheme"). The models will continue to get better (and are already crazy good), so prompting will only get easier.

## What should I do when I hit an error?

Either copy and paste the error back into the chat, or tell the AI agent that you got an error and it should try to resolve it.

## How long does it take to complete a project?

It depends on complexity. By breaking tasks into smaller steps, planning ahead, and refining based on feedback, you can move quickly while ensuring quality.
