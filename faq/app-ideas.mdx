# Coming up with App Ideas

## What kind of app should I build?

The best app idea is one that solves a problem you or someone you know experiences. Think about daily frustrations, activities you enjoy, or tasks you'd like to automate. Vibecode can help you build it quickly, regardless of complexity.

## Can I build a real business app?

Absolutely! Many successful apps started as small projects. With Vibecode's backend capabilities through Vibecode Cloud, you can build production-ready apps with user authentication, databases, and integrations right from the start.

## How do I find inspiration?

Look at the app stores, browse social media, read product hunt, or ask friends what they wish existed. Often the best ideas come from personal needs or gaps you notice in existing solutions.
