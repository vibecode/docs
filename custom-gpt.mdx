2. **Understand Your Vision** - It learns about your goals, target users, and key features
3. **Generate the Perfect Prompt** - Based on your answers, it creates a detailed, optimized prompt ready to use in Vibecode

## Why Use This?

- **Save Time** - No more staring at a blank screen trying to figure out what to build
- **Better Results** - A well-crafted prompt leads to better app generation
- **Clarify Your Thinking** - The process helps you understand your own idea better
- **Optimized for Vibecode** - The generated prompt is specifically tailored for Vibecode's AI capabilities

Simply have a conversation with the GPT, and it will produce a prompt you can immediately paste into Vibecode to start building your app!
