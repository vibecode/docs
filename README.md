# Vibecode docs

This is the documentation for Vibecode.

We use Mintlify to build and deploy our documentation.

The documentation is hosted at [vibecodeapp.com/docs](https://vibecodeapp.com/docs).

## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.
