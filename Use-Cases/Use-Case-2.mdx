# Make an Instagram Clone

Building an Instagram clone is a great way to learn how to create real apps with user authentication, databases, and cloud storage. These features allow you to build apps that users can actually sign into and have their data persist.

## Getting Started

Building an Instagram clone requires backend services like authentication, database, and storage. Here's how:

1. Open Vibecode and click "New Project"
2. Before entering your first prompt, enable **Vibecode Cloud** in the project settings
3. This gives you access to authentication, database, and storage features

## Why Backend Features Matter

When you enable backend features, you get:

- **Authentication** - Users can create accounts and sign in securely
- **Database** - Store user data and app content in the cloud
- **Storage** - Save images, videos, and other files in the cloud

This means you can create real apps where people can sign into their own accounts, and all of their data is stored safely in the cloud and persists across sessions and devices.

## Prompt Example

Once backend is enabled, use a prompt like:

```
Create an Instagram clone where users can sign up, log in, post photos with captions,
like other users' posts, and follow other users. Store all user data and posts in the database.
```

## Next Steps

After building your Instagram clone, try adding more features like direct messaging, hashtags, or explore feeds!
