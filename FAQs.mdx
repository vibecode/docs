  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I build efficiently with Vibecode?">
    We recommend starting by simplifying your idea into the essential features, then build from there. It also helps to have an initial prompt that details the expected outcome in terms of the look, feel, etc. of your app idea.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How should I structure my prompts for the best results?">
    Our AI Agent is pretty good at coming up with what is needed for building your app regardless of the prompt, but for specific features it is best to be as specific as possible. You can even suggest examples (e.g., "An app that is designed like Duolingo" or "make the app have the Google color scheme"). The models will continue to get better (and are already crazy good), so prompting will only get easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do when I hit an error?">
    Either copy and paste the error back into the chat, or tell the AI agent that you got an error and it should try to resolve it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to complete a project?">
    It depends on complexity. By breaking tasks into smaller steps, planning ahead, and refining based on feedback, you can move quickly while ensuring quality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to add take payments in my app or add paywalls with RevenueCat or Stripe?">
    You can integrate payment systems into your Vibecode app by prompting the AI to add payment functionality. Popular options include:
    
    **RevenueCat**: For in-app purchases and subscriptions
    - Simply ask the AI to "integrate RevenueCat for subscriptions"
    - Configure your RevenueCat account and add your API keys via Supabase secrets
    
    **Stripe**: For one-time payments and custom payment flows
    - Prompt the AI to "add Stripe payment integration"
    - Use Stripe's API with proper key management through Supabase
    
    **Important**: Never hardcode API keys in your app. Always use environment variables or Supabase secrets for sensitive credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I publish my app to the App Store?">
    To publish your app to the Apple App Store:
    
    1. **Export your code**: Download your complete source code from Vibecode
    2. **Set up Apple Developer Account**: Enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
    3. **Configure your app**: Update app icons, bundle ID, and metadata
    4. **Build for production**: Create a production build using Xcode or EAS Build
    5. **Submit for review**: Upload to App Store Connect and submit for review
    
    Check our detailed guide on "Deploy to App Store" in the Getting Started section for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add a backend, database, or authentication to the app? (Firebase/Supabase)">
    You can add backend services by integrating with Firebase or Supabase:
    
    **Supabase** (Recommended):
    - Prompt the AI: "Add Supabase authentication and database"
    - Create a Supabase project and get your API keys
    - Store credentials securely using Supabase secrets
    - Use Supabase Edge Functions for server-side logic
    
    **Firebase**:
    - Ask the AI to "integrate Firebase authentication and Firestore"
    - Set up your Firebase project
    - Configure authentication methods (email, Google, etc.)
    
    **Note**: Be careful with authentication - if implemented incorrectly, you could lock yourself out of your app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I start a new chat with the agent?">
    To start a new chat session:
    1. Look for the "New Chat" or "+" button in the Vibecode workspace
    2. This will create a fresh conversation while preserving your existing chats
    3. You can always return to previous chats by selecting them from your chat history
    
    Starting a new chat is useful when you want to begin a completely new project or explore a different idea.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I download my project's code?">
    To download your project code:
    1. Open your project in the Vibecode workspace
    2. Look for the "Export" or "Download Code" option in the menu
    3. Select the export format (typically a ZIP file)
    4. Your complete source code will be downloaded, including all dependencies
    
    The exported code is a complete React Native/Expo project that you can run locally, modify, and deploy as you wish.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?">
    Yes! You can integrate with backend services like Supabase or Firebase. Simply prompt the AI to add backend connectivity, and it will guide you through the integration process. This allows you to store user data, implement authentication, and build more complex applications.

    We currently have a Vibecode Cloud feature in beta that allows you to add a backend to your app. It is not yet fully functional.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add login to my app?">
    We currently do not support Auth/DB, so we do not recommend adding this feature even though it is possible. If it is added, there is a chance you could lock yourself out of your own app without being able to recover it since there is no database functionality (yet).

    We currently have a Vibecode Cloud feature in beta that allows you to add a backend to your app. It is not yet fully functional.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect to my app using SSH?">
    To connect to your app via SSH:
    1. Navigate to the Export/SSH section in your workspace
    2. Enable SSH access for your project
    3. Use the provided connection details and credentials
    4. Connect using any SSH client or terminal
    
    SSH access allows you to interact with your app's development environment directly, useful for advanced debugging and configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are Vibecode apps actually native iOS/Android apps? Or is it just web apps?">
    Vibecode generates **true native mobile apps**, not web apps. Your apps are built using React Native and Expo, which compile to native iOS and Android code. This means:
    - Full access to native device features (camera, sensors, notifications, etc.)
    - Native performance and user experience
    - Ability to publish to app stores
    - Offline functionality
    
    While React Native uses JavaScript, the UI components are genuine native components, not web views.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Vibecode to build a web app?">
    Yes! While Vibecode primarily focuses on mobile apps, you can also build web applications. The same React Native codebase can be adapted for web using React Native Web or you can specifically request a web-focused build.
    
    Simply prompt the AI to "create a web app" or "make this compatible with web browsers" and it will generate the appropriate code.
  </Accordion>
