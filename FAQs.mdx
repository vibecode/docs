## Getting Started FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Vibecode?">
    Vibecode is the easiest way to build beautiful mobile apps. You can simply generate apps with prompting, view and test your app on your phone, improve and complete the development of your app, and share with anyone in 1-click using App Clips.

    Vibecoding allows you to create anything you imagine, and Vibecode is the first ever mobile app that brings the power of Vibecoding to the masses.

## Building Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I build efficiently with Vibecode?">
    We recommend starting by simplifying your idea into the essential features, then build from there. It also helps to have an initial prompt that details the expected outcome in terms of the look, feel, etc. of your app idea.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How should I structure my prompts for the best results?">
    Our AI Agent is pretty good at coming up with what is needed for building your app regardless of the prompt, but for specific features it is best to be as specific as possible. You can even suggest examples (e.g., "An app that is designed like Duolingo" or "make the app have the Google color scheme"). The models will continue to get better (and are already crazy good), so prompting will only get easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do when I hit an error?">
    Either copy and paste the error back into the chat, or tell the AI agent that you got an error and it should try to resolve it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to complete a project?">
    It depends on complexity. By breaking tasks into smaller steps, planning ahead, and refining based on feedback, you can move quickly while ensuring quality.

## Data & Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?">
    This is a feature that is coming very soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add login to my app?">
    We currently do not support Auth/DB, so we do not recommend adding this feature even though it is possible. If it is added, there is a chance you could lock yourself out of your own app without being able to recover it since there is no database functionality (yet).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add third-party APIs to my project?">
    Yes, you can add authentication by integrating with Supabase. Simply prompt the AI to add it and follow the instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I store sensitive API keys in Vibecode?">
    No! Never enter your API keys directly in Vibecode. If you're integrating with an API, we recommend you use Supabase secrets to store your API keys, in combination with the Supabase Edge Functions.
