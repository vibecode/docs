## How to Add Animations

Just describe the animation you want:

<CodeGroup>
```text Fade In
"When the screen loads, fade in the content over 0.5 seconds"
```

```text Bounce Button
"When the button is pressed, scale it down slightly,
then bounce back to normal size"
```

```text Swipe to Delete
"Let users swipe left on list items to reveal a delete button,
swipe all the way to delete immediately"
```

```text Pull to Refresh
"Add pull-to-refresh at the top of the list that shows
a loading spinner and refetches data"
```

```text Page Transition
"When navigating to detail screen, slide in from right
with a fade effect"
```
</CodeGroup>

Claude will choose the right animation approach and implement it!

## Common Animation Patterns

### Button Press Feedback

Make buttons feel responsive:

**Effects:**
- Scale down slightly when pressed
- Change color/opacity
- Haptic feedback
- Quick bounce-back

**Example:**
```text
"When the save button is tapped, scale it down to 95%,
add haptic feedback, then bounce back with a success checkmark"
```

### List Item Animations

Bring lists to life:

**Entry animations:**
- Fade in one by one
- Slide in from side
- Scale up from center
- Stagger (cascading effect)

**Exit animations:**
- Fade out
- Slide away
- Shrink and disappear
- Collapse space smoothly

**Example:**
```text
"When items are added to the todo list, fade them in
from the top with a slight downward slide"
```

### Screen Transitions

Navigate smoothly between screens:

**Transition types:**
- Slide (left/right/up/down)
- Fade
- Modal (slide up from bottom)
- Flip
- Zoom
- Shared element

**Example:**
```text
"When tapping a photo thumbnail, expand it to full screen
with a zoom animation, maintaining position during transition"
```

<Info>
Shared element transitions make related screens feel connected—like tapping an image that smoothly expands into a detail view.
</Info>

### Loading States

Show progress elegantly:

**Options:**
- Skeleton screens (content placeholder)
- Shimmer effect (loading wave)
- Spinner with fade-in
- Progress bar
- Pulsing placeholders

**Example:**
```text
"While loading data, show skeleton cards that shimmer.
When data arrives, fade out skeletons and fade in real content"
```

### Pull to Refresh

Classic mobile pattern:

**How it works:**
1. User pulls down on list
2. Loading indicator appears
3. Data refreshes
4. Indicator hides, list updates

**Example:**
```text
"Add pull-to-refresh with a circular loading spinner.
Show 'Refreshing...' text and haptic feedback when triggered"
```

### Swipeable Items

Touch-friendly gestures:

**Common uses:**
- Swipe to delete
- Swipe to archive
- Swipe for actions (like Mail app)
- Swipe between pages

**Example:**
```text
"Let users swipe email items left to show delete/archive buttons,
or swipe right to mark as read. Smooth spring animation on release"
```

## Advanced Animation Concepts

### Spring Physics

Natural, bouncy animations:

**Settings:**
- **Stiffness** - How tight the spring (higher = faster)
- **Damping** - Bounce amount (lower = more bouncy)
- **Mass** - Weight feeling (higher = slower)

**When to use:**
- Interactive elements
- Gesture releases
- Natural motion
- Playful feel

**Example:**
```text
"When modal appears, use a bouncy spring animation
that overshoots slightly then settles"
```

### Gesture Animations

Animations that follow your finger:

**Techniques:**
- Pan (drag)
- Pinch (zoom)
- Rotation
- Multi-touch

**Example:**
```text
"Build a photo viewer where users can pinch to zoom,
drag to pan, and rotate with two fingers. Animations
follow finger movement smoothly"
```

### Stagger Animations

Create cascading effects:

**How it works:**
- Animate items one after another
- Small delay between each
- Creates flowing effect

**Example:**
```text
"When the menu appears, fade in each menu item with
a 50ms delay between them, starting from the top"
```

### Sequence Animations

Multiple animations in order:

**Pattern:**
1. First animation completes
2. Second animation starts
3. Third animation follows
4. And so on...

**Example:**
```text
"When submitting form:
1. Scale down the submit button
2. Show a checkmark with fade in
3. Slide up a success message
4. After 2 seconds, navigate to home screen"
```

### Parallel Animations

Multiple animations at once:

**Example:**
```text
"When the card appears, simultaneously:
- Fade in from 0 to 100% opacity
- Slide up 20 pixels
- Scale from 95% to 100%
All over 400ms with ease-out timing"
```

## Lottie Animations

Use designer-created animations:

### What is Lottie?

- Animation files exported from After Effects
- JSON format (small file size)
- Fully customizable
- Professional quality

### Where to Get Lottie Files

- LottieFiles.com (thousands free)
- Create your own in After Effects
- Hire designer on Fiverr/Upwork
- Use Vibecode AI to generate (coming soon)

### How to Use

**Example:**
```text
"Add a Lottie loading animation from this URL:
[lottie file URL]
Play it while data is loading, then fade it out"
```

**Customization:**
```text
"Use this Lottie success checkmark animation, but change
the green color to blue to match my brand"
```

## Micro-interactions

Small animations that matter:

**Examples:**
- **Like button** - Heart pops and changes color
- **Toggle switch** - Smooth slide with color change
- **Input focus** - Border color animates in
- **Checkbox** - Checkmark draws in
- **Badge** - Number increments with bounce

These tiny details make apps feel premium.

<Tip>
**Less is more:** Don't animate everything. Use animations purposefully where they add value or clarity.
</Tip>

## Animation Timing

### Duration

How long animations should last:

- **Fast** (100-200ms) - Micro-interactions, hover effects
- **Normal** (300-400ms) - Most transitions, fades
- **Slow** (500-800ms) - Complex transitions, page changes
- **Very slow** (1000ms+) - Cinematic effects, splash screens

**Rule of thumb:** Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to see what happened.

### Easing Functions

How animations accelerate/decelerate:

- **Linear** - Constant speed (robotic, rarely used)
- **Ease-in** - Starts slow, ends fast
- **Ease-out** - Starts fast, ends slow (most common)
- **Ease-in-out** - Slow start and end, fast middle
- **Spring/Bounce** - Overshoots then settles

**Example:**
```text
"Slide the modal in with ease-out timing so it
decelerates smoothly as it settles into place"
```

<Info>
Most animations should use ease-out—it feels natural because objects in the real world decelerate as they come to rest.
</Info>

## Performance Tips

<Tip>
**Use native driver:** Tell Claude to use the native animation driver for smooth 60fps performance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Avoid animating layout:** Animate transforms (translate, scale, rotate) and opacity—these are super fast. Avoid animating width/height which is slower.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Reduce complexity:** Simpler animations perform better. If it's laggy, simplify the effect.
</Tip>

## Accessibility

Make animations accessible:

**Considerations:**
- Respect "Reduce Motion" system setting
- Provide alternative feedback (haptics)
- Don't rely solely on animation to convey info
- Keep motion subtle to avoid nausea

**Example:**
```text
"Add a slide-in animation for new items, but if the user
has 'Reduce Motion' enabled, just fade them in instead"
```

## Example Animation Prompts

### Beginner

```text Simple Fade
"When the welcome screen appears, fade in the logo
over 1 second, then fade in the tagline below it"
```

### Intermediate

```text Interactive List
"Make the todo list items swipeable:
- Swipe right to mark complete (green background)
- Swipe left to delete (red background)
- Spring back if not swiped far enough
- Smooth slide-out animation when deleted"
```

### Advanced

```text Complex Transition
"Build an Instagram-style photo grid. When tapping a photo:
- Expand it smoothly from grid position to full screen
- Fade out other photos
- Show detail info sliding up from bottom
- Swipe down to dismiss with spring physics
- Return photo to exact grid position"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Animations laggy?**
- Use native driver
- Simplify the animation
- Reduce number of simultaneous animations
- Check device performance

**Animation feels wrong?**
- Adjust timing (try slower/faster)
- Change easing function
- Add spring physics
- Reduce distance traveled

**Gesture not working?**
- Check gesture handler is enabled
- Verify touch area is large enough
- Ensure no overlapping touch handlers
- Test on real device (not simulator)
