# Tips & Tricks

## Write detailed prompts

The more specific your instructions, the better the output. Instead of "make a button," try "create a green button with rounded corners that says 'Get Started' and triggers a success sound."

## Iterate quickly

Build your app in small increments. Make one feature, test it, then move to the next. This approach helps you catch issues early and refine your vision as you go.

## Use Vibecode Cloud for real apps

If you want to build an app with user data, authentication, or backend logic, use Vibecode Cloud. It handles all the infrastructure so you can focus on your app's core features.
