## Before You Start

You'll need the following:

- [**Vibecode Pro Plan**](/introduction/plans-and-credits) (upgrade in your account settings if needed)
- [**RevenueCat Account**](https://www.revenuecat.com/) (sign up for free)
- [**Apple Developer Program Membership**](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) ($99/year)

## Step 1: Connect Your RevenueCat Account

1. Open your project in Vibecode
2. Click the **Payments** tab

<Tip>If the popup is blocked, check your browser's popup settings and try again.</Tip>

## Step 2: Configure Your App Identity

After connecting, you'll set up your app identity:

1. **Display Name** - Your app's name as it appears on the home screen
2. **Bundle Identifier** - A unique identifier for your app (Vibecode auto-generates one)

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of app identity configuration form */}

<Warning>Your Bundle Identifier cannot be changed after your first build. Choose carefully!</Warning>

Click **Continue** to complete the setup.

## Step 3: Configure RevenueCat Credentials

<Note>This step is critical! Without these credentials, your in-app purchases will not work.</Note>

For RevenueCat to communicate with App Store Connect, you need to set up two API keys in your RevenueCat dashboard:

### App Store Connect API Key

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → **Users and Access** → **Integrations** → **App Store Connect API**
2. Click **Generate API Key** with "App Manager" access level
3. Download the `.p8` file (you can only download this once!)
4. Note your **Issuer ID** from this page
5. In RevenueCat, go to your app's settings and upload the `.p8` file
6. Enter your Issuer ID and Vendor number (found in App Store Connect under **Payments and Financial Reports**)

### In-App Purchase Key

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → **Users and Access** → **Integrations** → **In-App Purchase**
2. Click **Generate In-App Purchase Key**
3. Download the `.p8` file (you can only download this once!)
4. In RevenueCat, upload this key in the **In-app purchase key configuration** section
5. Add your Issuer ID and save

<Warning>The In-App Purchase key is required. Without it, transactions will fail to be recorded when using StoreKit 2.</Warning>

## Step 4: Create Your Product with AI

Ask the Vibecode AI to create your subscription or in-app purchase product:

**Example prompts:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Monthly Subscription
Create a monthly premium subscription for $4.99
```
```text Yearly with Trial
Add a yearly subscription with a 7-day free trial
```
```text One-Time Purchase
Create a one-time purchase to remove ads for $2.99
```
</CodeGroup>

The AI will create the product in RevenueCat for you.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of AI chat creating a product */}

## Step 5: Create a Paywall

Ask the AI to create a paywall screen for your app:

**Example prompts:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Basic Paywall
Create a paywall screen showing my subscription options
```
```text Premium Upgrade
Add a premium upgrade screen with monthly and yearly options
```
```text Feature Gate
Show a paywall when users try to access pro features
```
</CodeGroup>

<img src="/payments/paywall-example.png" alt="Paywall example" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

## Step 6: Test in Vibecode

Before publishing, test your paywall inside Vibecode:

1. Preview your app
2. Navigate to where the paywall appears
3. Verify the products display correctly
4. Test the purchase flow

<img src="/payments/test-store.png" alt="Test store" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

## Step 7: Sync Product with App Store Connect

<Note>This step creates your product in App Store Connect. You must complete this before your app can accept real payments.</Note>

Tell the AI to sync your product with App Store Connect:

**Example prompts:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Sync Products
Sync my RevenueCat products with App Store Connect
```
```text Publish Subscription
Publish my subscription to App Store Connect
```
</CodeGroup>

<img src="/payments/prompt-to-sync-products.png" alt="Sync products prompt" style={{maxHeight: '250px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

This creates the corresponding product in your App Store Connect account.

## Step 8: Complete Product Setup in App Store Connect

Your product was created but needs additional metadata before it can go live:

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Click on your app in the bottom left
3. Navigate to **Monetization** → **Subscriptions** (or **In-App Purchases**)
4. Click on the subscription group that was created
5. Select your product

<img src="/payments/app-store-connect-subscriptions-page.png" alt="App Store Connect subscriptions page" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

### Add Required Metadata

For each product, you need to add:

- **Display Name** - What users see during purchase
- **Description** - Explain what the subscription includes
- **Screenshot** - A screenshot showing your subscription in action

<img src="/payments/asc-missing-metadata.png" alt="App Store Connect missing metadata" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

<img src="/payments/asc-paywall-screenshot.png" alt="App Store Connect paywall screenshot" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

<Note>Your product will show "Missing Metadata" status until you add all required information including the screenshot.</Note>

Once all metadata is complete, the status will change and your product is ready for submission.

## Troubleshooting

There are many common issues that can prevent your products from working correctly. Please go through all of them and make sure they do not impact you.

**Can't connect to RevenueCat?**
- Check that popups aren't blocked in your browser
- Try refreshing the page and connecting again
- Ensure you're signed into your RevenueCat account

**Products not showing up?**
- Click **Refresh** in the Payment Dashboard
- Verify products are created in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat
- Check that products are linked to the correct app in RevenueCat

**Product shows "Missing Metadata"?**
- Go to App Store Connect and add all required fields
- Make sure to upload a screenshot for the product
- Save your changes and the status will update

**Purchases failing in testing?**
- Ensure you're using a valid Sandbox Tester account
- Sign out of your regular Apple ID first
- Check that your app's bundle ID matches App Store Connect

**Products not appearing in TestFlight?**

When subscriptions or in-app purchase products don't appear in TestFlight, it's usually due to an incomplete setup in App Store Connect—missing legal entity information and incomplete agreements or tax information.

<img src="/payments/asc-legal.png" alt="App Store Connect Business Agreements" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

To fix this:
- Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → **Business** → **Agreements**
- Ensure your **Paid Apps Agreement** is active (not "New")
- Complete any pending legal entity information
- Fill out all required tax and banking information
- Make sure to also fill out all the metadata for your products in App Store Connect. You can do this by going to App -> Subscriptions -> Your Subscription -> Edit -> Metadata.

**Pending agreements blocking purchases?**

If you see a yellow warning banner in App Store Connect about updated agreements, you must clear all pending agreements before RevenueCat can process purchases.

<img src="/payments/asc-agreements.png" alt="App Store Connect pending agreements warning" style={{maxHeight: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} className="rounded-lg" />

To fix this:
- The **Account Holder** (not just any team member) must sign in to App Store Connect
- Review and accept any updated license agreements shown in the yellow banner
- Check **Business** → **Agreements** for any other pending agreements
- Once all agreements are accepted, the yellow warning will disappear and purchases will work
