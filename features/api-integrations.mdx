description: "Use AI models, data APIs, and more in your app—all billed through Vibecode credits at no markup"
---

Vibecode comes with a library of API integrations you can add to your app. AI models, image generators, weather data, stock prices, and more—all proxied securely through your backend and billed directly to your **Vibecode credits at no additional markup**.

No separate accounts. No API keys to manage. Just tell the AI what you need and it wires it up.

Browse pricing and details at [vibecodeapp.com/integrations](https://www.vibecodeapp.com/integrations).

## How it works

1. **Tell the AI what you need** — "Add AI chat to my app" or "Let users generate images"
2. **The AI adds the integration** — It sets up the API call in your backend, keeping keys secure
3. **Usage is billed to your credits** — No external accounts, no extra configuration

All API calls go through your backend server, so your keys are never exposed to users.

<Tip>
  You can use multiple integrations in the same app. A recipe app could use GPT for generating recipes, DALL-E for food images, and OpenWeather for seasonal suggestions—all from the same Vibecode credits.
