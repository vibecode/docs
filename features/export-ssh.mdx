SSH allows you to connect your Vibecode projects directly to code editors like Cursor. This gives you a secure, direct connection to your code so you can edit, deploy, and manage your app from your preferred development environment.

## Benefits of SSH

- Secure connection to your code repository
- Edit your Vibecode app in Cursor or other IDEs
- Deploy and manage your app from the command line
- Work with your team using standard development workflows
- Version control and collaboration tools built in

## Getting Started with SSH

- Open your app in the Pinch to Build menu
- Select the project name from the drop-down
- Click "Connect via SSH"
- Hit "Send email instructions" in the pop-up
- Follow the setup instructions sent to your email

Or you can copy the SSH command and password directly into Cursor.
