Haptics bring your app to life by adding touch feedback. When users interact with buttons, swipe through lists, or complete actions, haptic feedback confirms their gestures with physical vibrations. With Vibecode, you can add the right haptic response for every interactionâ€”from subtle taps to strong alerts. This makes your app feel more responsive and engaging.

Vibecode offers a range of haptic feedback options to match different interaction contexts:

- **Light Impact** - Subtle feedback for minor interactions like toggling switches
- **Medium Impact** - Noticeable feedback for standard button taps
- **Heavy Impact** - Strong feedback for significant actions like deletions or confirmations
- **Success** - Positive reinforcement for completed actions
- **Warning** - Alert users to important decisions
- **Error** - Signal that something went wrong
- **Selection** - Feedback for scrolling through pickers or lists

## Best Practices

- **Match the intensity to the action** - Use light haptics for frequent interactions and reserve heavy haptics for important moments.
- **Don't overuse** - Too much haptic feedback can feel overwhelming. Use it purposefully to enhance key interactions.
- **Test on real devices** - Haptics feel different across devices. Always test your patterns on actual hardware.
- **Consider accessibility** - Some users may have haptic feedback disabled in their system settings. Design your app to work well with or without haptics.

## What's Next?

Once you've added haptics to your app, you can:

- Preview your app on a real device to feel the haptics in action
- Customize timing for more complex haptic patterns
