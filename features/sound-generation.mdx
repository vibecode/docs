# Sounds and Music

Adding sound to your mobile app transforms how users experience it. A satisfying click confirms a button tap, a chime celebrates success, and ambient music sets the mood for focus or relaxation. With Vibecode, you can generate and integrate audio for any momentâ€”whether it's feedback on user actions, voice guidance, or immersive background music. The right sounds make your app feel polished, responsive, and memorable.
