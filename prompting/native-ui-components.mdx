Copy and paste these prompts directly into Vibecode to implement native iOS components.

## Large Header Titles

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
We want a large header title on the screen. 

Using a React Navigation Native Stack navigator, set `headerLargeTitle: true` and `headerTransparent: true` in screen options. 

In the screen component, use a `ScrollView` as the outermost component with `style={{ flex: 1 }}` and `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"`.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Context Menu

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
Use Zeego ContextMenu; open on long-press; map items/submenus with native look (no custom styling). 

Here are the docs: https://zeego.dev/components/context-menu
```
</CodeGroup>

## Liquid Glass Bottom Tabs

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
Use react-native-bottom-tabs and @bottom-tabs/react-navigation package to implement Native bottom tabs. 

Here are the docs: https://incubator.callstack.com/react-native-bottom-tabs/docs/guides/usage-with-react-navigation
```
</CodeGroup>

## Modals and Bottom Sheets

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
Use the @gorhom/bottom-sheet; define snap points, backdrop, and enablePanDownToClose for iOS feel. 

Make multiple snap points including a full screen version of the bottom sheet.
```
</CodeGroup>

## iOS-Style Switch

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
Use the native iOS style switch component. You can import this from "react-native"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Date and Time Pickers

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt
Use @react-native-community/datetimepicker; present mode="date" / "time" and handle onChange inline/modal on iOS. 

Make sure to make the text color black or some other color based on the background. Most backgrounds are white.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Haptics

Use Vibecode app's built-in [Haptics feature](/features/haptics) to add tactile feedback.
