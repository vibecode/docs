# Convert Web App to Mobile App with AI Vibe Coding (No code required)

Use this prompt to convert any web application into a native mobile app. Just attach your web app codebase and copy this prompt.

<CodeGroup>
```text Copy This Prompt
This is a web app that I made.

I want to convert this web app into a mobile app in react native.

One that would be a realistic mobile app based on this web app.

Think like a mobile designer, who was just given a web app, and was tasked to build a mobile app, but you are using the vibecode app, which is an AI app builder. What you need is the perfect prompt.

What I want you to do:

* You are creating a one pager-prompt to build the mobile version of this app.

* Analyze the entire codebase, and come up with a prompt for an app that builds mobile apps in react native with expo.

* Focus alot on styling and make it look like the mobile version of the web app.

* At the end of the prompt, if there are API's present, please write which api's are present and which API keys are needed. Include how to implement the API in a concise manner.

What i don't want you to do:

* Don't over explain the technical implementation.

* You are mostly focused on clearly explaining the user experience and functionality

* Don't give any input on how the mobile code should beâ€¦ the app builder will know what to do.
```

**How to use:** Copy the prompt above, attach your web app's codebase, and paste into Vibecode.
