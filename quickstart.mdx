Ready to turn your idea into an app? Follow these simple steps to get started with Vibecode.

## Get Started in Three Steps

### Step 1: Download and Sign Up

Download Vibecode from the App Store or access it on the web at [vibecodeapp.com](https://www.vibecodeapp.com).

Create your account using your email or preferred authentication method. You'll start with free credits to build your first apps!

### Step 2: Create Your First App

**1. Start a New Project**

Tap "New project" on the home screen and think about what you want to build. It can be anything - a to-do list, a game, a productivity tool, or something completely unique.

**2. Describe Your Idea**

Type out your app idea in as much detail as you'd like. The more specific you are, the better Vibecode can understand what you want to build.

**3. Hit Generate**

Press "Generate" and watch as Vibecode builds your app in real-time. The AI will create a fully functional app based on your description.

### Step 3: Customize and Test

Once your app is generated, test it out! Use the [Pinch to Build](/Features/Pinch-to-Build) menu (long-press on your screen) to make changes:

- Adjust colors and styling
- Add haptic feedback
- Modify features and functionality
- Fix any issues you notice

<Tip>Start simple! Build one feature at a time and test after each change.</Tip>
