# Glossary

A collection of important terms and definitions used in Vibecode and app development.

## Vibecode Terms

**Vibecode**
The platform and app that lets you build mobile apps using natural language prompts powered by AI.

**Vibecoding**
The act of building apps using Vibecode - combining creativity with AI to bring your ideas to life without traditional coding.

**Pinch to Build**
The interactive menu (accessed via long-press gesture) that allows you to fully customize and modify your app without leaving the Vibecode app.

**Claude Code**
The AI coding agent that powers Vibecode, optimized specifically for mobile app generation.

**Credits**
Vibecode uses a wholesale credit system where $1 of credits equals exactly $1 of AI provider costs.

**App Clips**
The technology that allows you to share your Vibecode apps instantly with others without requiring them to install anything from the App Store.

## App Development Terms

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A way for you to add features to your app that use other services like weather data, stock market data, text generation by OpenAI, image generation by Google Gemini, audio generation by ElevenLabs, and more. Vibecode supports integrating various APIs into your apps without API keys or complex setup.

**API Key**
A unique identifier used to authenticate your app with an API provider. You can store your API keys in Vibecode Cloud for secure storage. Or you can use the APIs we provide without keys!

**Backend**
The server-side of an application that handles data storage, user authentication, and business logic.

**Frontend**
The client-side of an application that users interact with directly - the interface and user experience.

**Haptics**
Tactile feedback (vibrations) that provide physical responses to user actions in your app.

**SSH (Secure Shell)**
SSH allows you to connect Vibecode projects directly to code editors like Cursor. This gives you a secure, direct connection to your code so you can edit, deploy, and manage your app from your preferred development environment.

**Widget**
With the Vibecode widget, you can add your apps to your home screen and launch them faster.

**QR Code**
A scannable code generated by the web app that lets you instantly open your project in the Vibecode mobile app.

## AI Terms

**Prompt**
The text description you provide to the AI that describes what you want your app to do or how you want it to look.

**Model**
The specific AI system used to generate your app (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5).

**Context**
The information and conversation history the AI uses to understand your requests and generate appropriate code.

**Iteration**
The process of making incremental improvements to your app by testing and refining through multiple prompts.
