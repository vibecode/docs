## How It Works

When you ask the AI to add push notifications to your app, Vibecode handles the code automatically. But push notifications also require some **one-time setup** in the Apple Developer portal and Expo dashboard that you'll do yourself.

Here's the high-level flow:

1. **Build your app** in Vibecode with push notification functionality
2. **Submit to the App Store** via Expo Launch (creates a native build)
3. **Create an APNs key** in the Apple Developer portal
4. **Upload the key to Expo** so it can send notifications through Apple
5. **Configure your project** with the Expo Project ID
6. **Test** by sending a notification to your device via TestFlight

## Features

- Cross-platform support (iOS and Android)
- Foreground, background, and lock-screen delivery
- Custom notification titles, messages, and sounds
- Data payloads for deep linking and navigation
- Delivery receipts to verify notifications were received
- Backend integration for server-triggered notifications

## Use Cases

- **Reminders** — task due dates, habit tracking, calendar events
- **Real-time alerts** — new messages, order updates, price changes
- **User engagement** — daily streaks, weekly summaries, new content
- **Social** — friend requests, likes, comments, follows
- **Transactional** — payment confirmations, shipping updates

## Requirements

- **Apple Developer Program** ($99/year) — required for iOS push notifications
- **Physical device** — push tokens can't be generated on simulators
- **TestFlight build** — push notifications don't work in Vibecode preview or Expo Go
