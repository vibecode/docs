Vibecode follows an industry-first "Wholesale Credit System". This means that \$1 on the Vibecode platform is exactly the \$1 cost we incur from the AI model providers like OpenAI for GPT-5 or Anthropic for Claude 4 Sonnet.

This allows us to offer the most fair, transparent, and aligned pricing system with our users. We make no money when you are using our AI Agent. In the future, we plan to make money by offering hosting, deployment, payments, and other related services to build production-ready apps.

Vibecode is a subscription based service with a free plan and 3 paid plans. When you pay for a subscription you get access to more features, and more credits. You need credits to send messages in Vibecode.
