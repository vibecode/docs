We built a brand-new web app for Vibecode so you can create your apps right from your computer—perfect if you prefer typing or working on a bigger screen.

With our web app, you can brainstorm ideas, design, and build just like you would on your phone, but with the efficiency of your desktop setup.

Once you’ve built an app, simply scan the displayed QR code, and your creation will instantly load on your phone for testing.

This means you can make changes from your computer and see updates live on your device for a truly seamless workflow.

It’s the easiest way to go back and forth. You can design on desktop, test on mobile, all in real time.

And when you’re ready to go public, you can deploy your app straight to the App Store with just a click ([see how here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/B2L4wXVK2EvXY0Bz7IJC/s/qo5eVMRGQyKev49voIYs/getting-started/deploy-to-the-app-store)). This will be coming to the mobile app very soon.
