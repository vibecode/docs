Vibecode uses Claude Code, the best mobile app coding agent in the world. We needed the smartest coding agent to intelligently use [haptics](/Features/Haptics), [sound generation](/Features/Sound-Generation), and [image generation](/Features/Image-Generation) to build the best mobile apps possible. This is the best way to get the most out of Claude Code to build your mobile app.

Claude Code works very similarly in the Vibecode app and is very similar to Claude Code that we all know and love. It's been specifically optimized for mobile app generation, so you get the same powerful reasoning and problem-solving abilities you're familiar with, but tailored for building amazing mobile experiences.

## Best Practices for Using Claude Code

1. **Plan before building** - Ask Claude to plan first, then review the plan before execution. This prevents mistakes and saves time.

2. **Be specific and detailed** - Provide clear, precise instructions instead of vague requests. Include expected behaviors and specific details you want handled.

3. **Use persistent context** - Document your coding patterns and style preferences so Claude automatically follows your established patterns without re-explaining them.

4. **Clear context frequently** - Use clear commands between different tasks to reset the context and improve output quality.

5. **Leverage visual references** - Use file mentions and provide screenshots or design mocks when relevant to eliminate ambiguity.
