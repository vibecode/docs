The default AI coding agent within the Vibecode app is Claude Code. The Vibecode app uses Claude Code out of the box to generate your apps, and it is the most powerful coding model in the world. We are adding Codecs from OpenAI very shortly.

For those of you who use Claude Code, it operates in a similar fashion, except it's made specifically for generating mobile apps from the Vibecode app. Claude Code brings advanced reasoning and multi-step problem-solving directly to mobile app generation, allowing for more complex and refined applications. It intelligently handles dependencies, optimizes code structure, and ensures your generated apps follow best practices for mobile development.
