description: "Use your own domain for your deployed Vibecode web app"
---

Want to use your own domain instead of the default `.vibecode.app` URL? This guide walks you through connecting a custom domain to your deployed Vibecode web app.

## Before You Start

You'll need:

- A **deployed Vibecode web app** (see [Deploying Your Web App](/deployments/guide) if you haven't deployed yet)
- A **domain you own** with access to its DNS settings (e.g. via Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

## Step 1: Open the Domain Tab

In your deployment dashboard, click the **Domain** tab.

  style={{ maxHeight: "400px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

{/* TODO: Add annotated screenshot highlighting the Domain tab */}

## Step 2: Add Your Domain

Click the **Add Custom Domain** button. You'll see a modal with two options.

  alt="Add Custom Domain modal with 'I have a domain' and 'Maybe later' options"
  style={{ maxHeight: "400px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Click **"I have a domain"** to continue.

## Step 3: Enter Your Domain

Type in your domain name — just the domain, no `http://` or `https://` prefix.

  alt="Domain input field with www redirect checkbox"
  style={{ maxHeight: "400px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

{/* TODO: Add annotated screenshot highlighting the domain input and www checkbox */}

- Enter your domain (e.g. `example.com`)
- Optionally check **"Redirect www to this domain"** if you want `www.example.com` to redirect to your apex domain
- Click **Save**

## Step 4: Configure DNS Records

After saving, Vibecode shows you the DNS records you need to add at your domain provider. The exact records depend on whether you're connecting an **apex domain** or a **subdomain**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Apex domain (e.g. example.com)">
    <img
      src="/deployments/custom-domain/04b-dns-records-apex.png"
      alt="DNS records for apex domain showing ALIAS and CNAME records"
      style={{ maxHeight: "500px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    | Type | Name | Target |
    |------|------|--------|
    | CNAME or ALIAS | `@` | `<your-project>.vibecode.run` |
    | CNAME | `www` | `<your-project>.vibecode.run` |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subdomain (e.g. app.example.com)">
    <img
      src="/deployments/custom-domain/04-dns-records.png"
      alt="DNS records for subdomain showing CNAME records"
      style={{ maxHeight: "500px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

    | Type | Name | Target |
    |------|------|--------|
    | CNAME | `app` | `<your-project>.vibecode.run` |
    | CNAME | `www.app` | `<your-project>.vibecode.run` |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  The `www` record only appears if you enabled the www redirect in the previous step.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Some DNS providers don't support CNAME records on the apex domain (`@`). In that case, use an **ALIAS** or **ANAME** record instead — most modern providers support this. See the provider guides below for specifics.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Add Records at Your DNS Provider

Go to your DNS provider's dashboard and add the records from the previous step. Here are direct links to guides for popular providers:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 6: Verify Your Domain

Once you've added the DNS records, go back to the Domain tab in Vibecode and click **"Check now"**. Vibecode will verify that your DNS records are set up correctly.

<Note>
  DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to **24–48 hours** to propagate. If verification fails, wait a bit and try again.
</Note>

Once verified, you'll see a green **"Domain verified"** banner confirming routing is correct. Click **"Done"** to finish, then deploy to activate your custom domain.

  alt="Domain verified confirmation showing routing is correct"
  style={{ maxHeight: "500px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}

## Troubleshooting

  style={{ maxHeight: "500px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

{/* TODO: Add annotated screenshot highlighting the troubleshoot section */}

Click **"Troubleshoot"** in the Domain tab to see common issues. Here are the most frequent ones:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cloudflare proxy conflict">
    If you're using Cloudflare, make sure the DNS record is set to **DNS-only mode** (gray cloud icon), not **Proxied** (orange cloud). Cloudflare's proxy can interfere with domain verification.

    Alternatively, if your provider blocks CNAME on the apex domain, use an **ALIAS** or **ANAME** record instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A/AAAA record conflict">
    If you already have A or AAAA records pointing your domain somewhere else, they'll conflict with the CNAME record. **Remove the old A/AAAA records first**, then add the CNAME.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DNS propagation delay">
    DNS changes don't take effect instantly. It can take up to **48 hours** for records to propagate worldwide. If the check fails right after adding records, wait 15–30 minutes and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need to start over?">
    You can click **"Remove domain"** in the Domain tab to disconnect your custom domain and start the process from scratch.
  </Accordion>
