Visuals make your app stand out. AI-powered image generation lets you create custom photos, illustrations, gradients, and icons without leaving Vibecode. Vibecode uses the GPT-4 Image One image model, which can generate images without backgrounds, giving you more flexibility in your designs. Whether you need a unique splash screen, branded visuals, or perfectly matched icons, you can describe what you want and let AI bring it to life. This makes it easy to keep your design consistent and professional.

## Generate Images and Icons

1. Navigate to the **Images & Icons** tab at the bottom of your project interface
2. Select which type of image you want to generate
3. Select which images and icons you want to add to include in your prompt to add to your app

### Example Prompt:

```
Please create a simple splash screen that puts the {{logo}}
above my {{image}}. Add text at the bottom of that screen
that says "Anthropic"
```

> **Note:** These are brand assets that were uploaded but you can generate your own image and ask AI to place those images in the app instead.

### Replacing Generated Images:

```
// Please replace the image beneath "Claude" with this {{image}}
that I just generated.
```

## Icons

You can also add icons.

When in the image tab, select **Icons**. This will make sure you are using the best image model in the world for generating icons.

After selecting "Icon" just describe the type of icon you want to include in your app.
