## Adding Images in your app (Examples)

You can ask the AI to generate images, then insert them in the app.

### Example Prompt:

```
Please create a simple splash screen that puts the {{logo}}
above my {{image}}. Add text at the bottom of that screen
that says "Anthropic"
```

> **Note:** These are brand assets that were uploaded but you can generate your own image and ask AI to place those images in the app instead.

### Replacing Generated Images:

```
// Please replace the image beneath "Claude" with this {{image}}
that I just generated.
```

## Icons

You can also add icons.

When in the image tab, select **Icons**. This will make sure you are using the best image model in the world for generating icons.

After selecting "Icon" just describe the type of icon you want to include in your app.
