# Sounds and Music

## Giving your mobile app sound

Sound effects in Vibecode let you add audio responses to any user interaction, from button clicks to notifications, creating a more immersive experience by pairing visual elements with audio cues.

There are three main types of audio you can generate and place into your app.

To add sound effects simply select the audio tab.

## The three main types of audio that you can add to your app

1. **Sound Effects**
2. **Voiceover**
3. **Background Music**

Let's start with the one that is most used in mobile apps:
