With Vibecode you can create any type of haptic feedback. Vibecode offers a range of haptic feedback options to match different interaction contexts:

- **Light Impact** - Subtle feedback for minor interactions like toggling switches
- **Medium Impact** - Noticeable feedback for standard button taps
- **Heavy Impact** - Strong feedback for significant actions like deletions or confirmations
- **Success** - Positive reinforcement for completed actions
- **Warning** - Alert users to important decisions
- **Error** - Signal that something went wrong
- **Selection** - Feedback for scrolling through pickers or lists

## Best Practices

- **Match the intensity to the action** - Use light haptics for frequent interactions and reserve heavy haptics for important moments.
- **Don't overuse** - Too much haptic feedback can feel overwhelming. Use it purposefully to enhance key interactions.
- **Test on real devices** - Haptics feel different across devices. Always test your patterns on actual hardware.
- **Consider accessibility** - Some users may have haptic feedback disabled in their system settings. Design your app to work well with or without haptics.

## What's Next?

Once you've added haptics to your app, you can:

- Preview your app on a real device to feel the haptics in action
- Customize timing for more complex haptic patterns
